# Christmas Tree Generator

This is a simple C# program that generates a colorful ASCII art Christmas tree with randomly placed ornaments that blink every 100 milliseconds, a brown trunk, and a horizontally centered "Merry Christmas!" message below the trunk, written in white.

## Getting Started

To use this program, clone the repository and build the solution using Visual Studio or a compatible development environment. The program can be run from the command line by passing the desired width of the tree as the first argument. For example:

```
ChristmasTree.exe 15
```
